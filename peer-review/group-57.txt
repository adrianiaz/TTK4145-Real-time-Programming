-Channel-names not always so intuitive/clear for instance the channel masterIdToSendAndReceiveToMasterCh; its hard to understand what it does
-Orders are backed up from file- easy to see, also have a solution if file is not there
-functions stay within their scope, using pure functions where possible, and keeping code that affects outside world in the open, where it can be seen (core and shell )
-We get a good overview of the components/modules of the system by just looking at the main file. We can see all big threads initialized there
-Modules are made elegant, indentation is kept under control for the most part, few enough channels to easily keep track of dataflow and the channels in the arguments uses arrows to indicate direction. For instance the SendAndReceiveToSlaves module in master.go solves the problem of sharing the connections map with few lines & readable code. 
-It seems like the creators have designed the system with fault-tolerance in mind. They use process-pairs in case of a crash, the aforementioned backup-from-file,  they use tcp to ensure acknowledgement from the slaves (backup-master), and they have used mutex sparingly in a suitable manner where the situation calls for it. 
-The code seems to able to scale well with small changes.

-By looking at the main function it is impossible to see how modules interact, because a lot of information is hidden in huge modules.
-The function Run(...) affects the "outside world", and does too much as the name would suggest.This makes it harder to follow data-flow. Additionally there are three Run functions in this workspace, so the same problems appears threefold.
-The three Run()- functions are the biggest modules in the program, they inevitably have to affect the outside world, it is hard to avoid that the scope is larger than the function scope.
-For every function you want to understand, you have to look in several different folders/files in order to find the relevant defenitions. This makes it hard to follow.
-The structure of files and folders seems to be split up unnecessarily. At the same time they use giant modules. They should instead focus on splitting up the big modules, as opposed to the aforementioned unnecessary splitting.
-The code may work but it seems impossible to evaluate if it does or not, due to the previous points. If it were to be expanded it would maybe be easier to start anew.

-In general good structure and easily readable code. 
-Can follow the code/the flow of information without having to jump a lot between files and folders. They have been consistent with how they implement modules.
-Seems like the different threads deal with what they're suppose to, and nothing more.
-Can identify the topology (circular) by looking at the code.
-Variable names are good, and they use metaphors in a suitable manner (phoenix, garbage, deathbed etc.)
-They have taken measures for better fault-tolerance; handled cases where nodes disconnects, and what a node does if it goes offline etc.
-This seems to scale pretty good. They have set all config-variables in a single files, which makes it easy to change things like num of elevators etc.

-The group seems to have taken measures for handling fault tolerance, such as processing-pairs in case of a crash, backup to local file.
-It is also easy to identify that they use a peer to peer topology by looking at the code.
-The group however, make their code hard to read due to a lot of indentation, and lack of pure functions that could make it more readable.
-The other main problem with this project is too big modules. The function CommunicationHandler is the best example of this, as it "handles" much more than just communication. An example of this is that the worldview gets updated within this module.
-They could have organized/named their functions better. For instance the previously mentioned CommunicationHandler, and a boolean variable "status".
-Their project has some good features and that makes it possible to see what they are trying to do with the design. However, the code does not lend itself to further development/ new features without much work.

-They use nested functions inside functions that interacts with the outside world, should be avoided. example: The function Fsm_onRequestButtonPress sends an updated request to the channel upd_request; additionally, Fsm_onRequestButtonPress is within the function Fsm_setCabOrders which gets called from main. 
-It is really hard to try to trace a buttonpress from start to finish due to nested functions, cross-interaction between modules and 
-The code is not organized with a reader in mind using too long argument lists, and names that are hard to make sense of. Some examples are rcd_req, cur_req , wld_updated_flag etc. Which are more confusing than helpful.
-the fsm is split into unnecessarily many parts, and you shouldn't need to look through many different function to understand how the elevator fsm works.
-The group has implemented some measures in case of a crash, like the watchdog which will crash the program. It will then restart a new instance of the program as well as a backup, making it protected against local crashes.
-One can see that this group has implemented a way to find a new master in case of the master disconnecting, which is good.
-The file structure is somewhat haphazard, it does not seem well thought through which leads to the seperation of many small functions in different folders that are related. This makes tracking the execution hard.
